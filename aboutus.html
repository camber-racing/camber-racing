          Camber Racing is the Formula Student combustion team of SRM IST,
          Chennai. The team was founded in 2009 when a group of young engineers
          decided to turn their dreams into reality and went on to make the
          first prototype, "CR800". Since then, there has been no looking back.
          Nine cars, 26 awards and 2 times National Champions.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="text-justify">
          The team comprises of passionate Undergraduate students from various
          diciplines and gives them a platform to apply and test their skills to
          the fullest. The team has been participating in various competitions,
          namely Formula Student Germany, Formula Bharat and Supra SAE India
          under the Combustion class for 10 glorious years.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="text-justify">
          Our teams goal is to develop individuals who are not only skilled in
          designing and engineering a race car, but also to help them gain
          experience in team work, project management, resource planning which
          makes them better engineers for the future. Hence, our team's motto,

          Formula Student is the largest student design engineering competition
          sanctioned by the Society of Automobile Engineers (SAE). Founded in
          1998 in the United States of America, it now has several competitions
          in various countries around the globe throughout the year. This
          competition has an objective to enable the student to design and
          fabricate an “Open Wheeled Weekend Racer” meeting certain standards
          and rules. The best team is not the one with the fastest car, but
          rather the one with cost-efficient manufacturing and feasible
          financial statements and sales pitches.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          The Competition has been divided into 2 sets of events, Dynamic and
          Static. The dynamic events include all the on-track bouts like
          Skid-Pad, Acceleration, Autocross and Endurance. The static events
          include a business plan and marketing strategy which tests cost
          analysis presentation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          Formula Student challenges the team members to go the extra mile in
          their education by enriching it with the real-life experience of what
          it takes to build and manufacture an industry-ready racecar while
          considering the economic aspects of the automotive industry. Teams
          operate under the assumption that they are a manufacturer developing a
          prototype to be evaluated for production. The target audience is the
          non-professional Weekend-Racer. The racecar must be equipped with
          characteristics such as acceleration, braking and handling.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          Teams face the challenge of composing a complete package consisting of
          a well-constructed racecar and a sales plan that best matches the
          given criteria. The decision is made by a jury of experts from the
          motorsport, automotive and supplier industries. The jury will judge
          every team's car and sales plan based on construction, cost planning
          and sales presentation. The rest of the judging will be done out on
          the track, where the students demonstrate in several performance tests
          how well their self-built racecars fare in the real environment.
